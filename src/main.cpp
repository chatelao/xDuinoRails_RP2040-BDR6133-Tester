 * @brief Closed-loop motor controller for a MÃ¤rklin motor using BEMF feedback.
 *
 * This firmware implements a closed-loop speed control system for a DC motor
 * using a XIAO RP2040 and a BDR-6133 H-bridge driver. Speed is measured by
 * counting back-EMF (BEMF) commutation pulses. A proportional controller
 * adjusts the motor power via a non-blocking, hardware-accelerated PWM signal
 * using the RP2040's timers. The system also includes a state machine to
 * run an automatic test pattern.
