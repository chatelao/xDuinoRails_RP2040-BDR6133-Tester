# Core Concepts

## Back-EMF (BEMF) Measurement
The library measures the Back Electromotive Force generated by the motor during the PWM "off" cycle. This voltage is proportional to the motor's speed. The library uses a filtering pipeline (EMA, Kalman) to clean this noisy signal.

## PI Controller
A Proportional-Integral (PI) controller adjusts the PWM duty cycle to match the measured speed to the target speed.
- **Proportional (P)**: Reacts to current error.
- **Integral (I)**: Reacts to accumulated error, eliminating steady-state error.

## Rangiermodus (Shunting Mode)
At low speeds (below 10%), the motor requires different control parameters due to non-linear friction and stiction. The library automatically switches to a "Rangiermodus" gain set for smoother low-speed operation.

## HAL Architecture
The library uses a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to support multiple architectures (RP2040, STM32, etc.). The HAL handles low-level PWM generation and synchronized ADC reading.
